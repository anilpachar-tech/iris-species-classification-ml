# iris-species-classification-ml
End-to-end machine learning project for Iris flower species classification using Python and Scikit-learn. Performed data analysis, visualization, model training (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest), hyperparameter tuning, and model evaluation. Achieved high accuracy and deployed the model using Joblib for future predictions.
